      <h1>About: William Tonkel</h1>
      <h6>
        I have walked through many different lives, I have been a student, a
        blue collar worker, a thrill seeker, a cynic, an optimist, a hardworker.
        I am currently persuing knowledge. I emjoy reading, learning the
        fundamentals of being a good human being and contributing to ones
        society. I am just starting in the corporate world so this will be
        interesting and also out of my comfort zone. I do not know how long I
        will last in it: will I rise to the top, or burnout? I have thoroughly
        enjoyed this coding bootcamp it has kept my mind occupied. I will
        continue to learn more as I go towards my goal of contributing to AI and
        blockchain technologies.
